'''This script generates request JSON for the Vision API.
Run the script using the following command:
  python generatejson.py \
      -i <input_file> \
      -o <output_file.json>
where the input file contains information on how to process a set of URIs, and
the output is a JSON request file.
The Python script reads an input text file that contains one line for each
image to process. Each line in the input file contains the URI of an image--for
example, its file location--and a space-separated list of
Feature:max_results to request for the image. The script associates each
Feature with an integer value from 1-6 (see the 'get_detection_type' function
definition).
For example, the following input file content requests face and label
detection annotations for image1, and landmark and logo detection annotations
for image2; each with a maximum of 10 results per annotation.
filepath_to_image1.jpg 1:10 4:10
filepath_to_image2.png 2:10 3:10
See https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/concepts for more detail, and for
information on using the generated result to send a request to the Vision API.

to annotate, 'feature' is a number from 1 to %s,
corresponding to the feature to detect, and max_results is a
number specifying the maximum number of those features to
detect.
The valid values - and their corresponding meanings - for
'feature' are:
